# Exam Space Platform Improvements

## Summary

This document outlines all the improvements and fixes applied to the Exam Space platform to address the following requirements:

1. **Webcam Picture-in-Picture**: Small screen showing candidate's face during exam
2. **Live Monitoring**: Real-time admin supervision of active exam sessions
3. **Recording Preview**: View recordings before downloading
4. **Bug Fixes**: Fixed storage path issues and removed failing Google Drive integration

---

## 🎥 Feature 1: Webcam Picture-in-Picture Recording

### What Was Added

- **Live Webcam Preview**: During the exam, candidates can see their own face in a small video preview box
- **Composite Recording**: The final recording combines screen capture with webcam overlay in the bottom-right corner
- **Canvas-Based Composition**: Uses HTML5 Canvas to merge screen and webcam streams in real-time

### Implementation Details

**File**: `src/components/VideoRecorder.tsx`

#### Key Changes:

1. **Added Refs for Video Composition**:
   ```typescript
   const webcamPreviewRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement>(null);
   const canvasRef = useRef<HTMLCanvasElement>(null);
   const compositeStreamRef = useRef<MediaStream | null>(null);
   ```

2. **Canvas Compositing**:
   - Creates a canvas matching the screen resolution
   - Draws screen capture as the base layer
   - Overlays webcam feed in bottom-right corner (20% of screen width)
   - Adds a blue border around the webcam for visibility
   - Captures the canvas at 30 FPS for recording

3. **Live Preview**:
   - Shows candidate's face in real-time during the exam
   - Displays "LIVE" indicator
   - Explains that the face will appear in the recording

### User Experience

**For Candidates**:
- See their own face during the exam (self-monitoring)
- Understand that their webcam is being recorded
- Visual confirmation that monitoring is active

**For Admins**:
- Recordings show both screen activity AND candidate's face
- Better supervision and verification of candidate identity
- Picture-in-picture layout doesn't obstruct exam content

## 📡 Feature 2: Live Monitoring Dashboard

### What Was Added

- **Real-Time Session Tracking**: See all active exam sessions instantly
- **Supabase Realtime Integration**: Automatic updates when candidates start/stop exams
- **Live Status Indicators**: Green pulse indicators for active sessions
- **Recording Status**: Shows whether recording is active or not for each candidate

### Implementation Details

**File**: `src/components/LiveMonitoring.tsx`

#### Key Features:

1. **Supabase Realtime Subscription**:
   ```typescript
   const channel = supabase
     .channel('live-monitoring')
     .on('postgres_changes', {
       event: '*',
       schema: 'public',
       table: 'candidate_sessions'
     }, (payload) => {
       loadActiveSessions();
     })
     .subscribe();
   ```

2. **Auto-Refresh**:
   - Real-time updates via Supabase channels
   - Backup polling every 10 seconds
   - Manual refresh button available

3. **Session Information Displayed**:
   - Candidate name and email
   - Exam title
   - Elapsed time
   - Recording status
   - "View Details" button to see full session

**File**: `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`
- Integrated LiveMonitoring component at the top of the dashboard
- Shows count of active sessions
- Provides quick access to session details

### User Experience

**For Admins**:
- Instant visibility into active exams
- No need to refresh the page
- Can quickly identify if recording is not working
- One-click access to detailed session review

## 🎬 Feature 3: Video Preview Before Download

### What Was Added

- **Preview Dialog**: Modal with embedded video player
- **Signed URL Generation**: Secure, time-limited URLs for video streaming
- **Download from Preview**: Option to download after previewing

### Implementation Details

**Files**: 
- `src/pages/Submissions.tsx`
- `src/pages/SessionReview.tsx`

#### Key Changes:

1. **Preview Button**:
   - Replaces direct "Watch" link
   - Loads video in a modal dialog
   - Shows loading state while fetching signed URL

2. **Video Dialog**:
   ```tsx
   <Dialog open={showVideoPreview} onOpenChange={setShowVideoPreview}>
     <DialogContent className="max-w-5xl">
       <video
         controls
         src={videoUrl}
         style={{ maxHeight: '70vh' }}
       />
       <Button onClick={downloadRecording}>
         Download Recording
       </Button>
     </DialogContent>
   </Dialog>
   ```

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Video scales to fit screen
   - Maximum 70% viewport height
   - Full playback controls

### User Experience

**For Admins**:
- Preview recordings without downloading large files
- Verify recording quality before download
- Scrub through video to find specific moments
- Download only if needed (saves bandwidth)

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fix 1: Storage Path Bug

**Problem**:
- `recording_url` was saving the full public URL instead of just the storage path
- This broke `download()` and `createSignedUrl()` methods
- Error: `400 Bad Request` when trying to access recordings

**Solution**:
- Changed to store only the file path (e.g., `"candidate-name-2025-10-26.webm"`)
- Updated all code to use storage path correctly
- Added proper error handling

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/VideoRecorder.tsx`
- `src/pages/Submissions.tsx`
- `src/pages/SessionReview.tsx`

**Code Example**:
```typescript
// Before (WRONG)
recording_url: urlData.publicUrl  // Full URL

// After (CORRECT)
recording_url: uploadData.path    // Just the path
```

### Fix 2: Removed Google Drive Integration

**Problem**:
- Edge Function `upload-to-drive` was not deployed (404 error)
- Code was trying Google Drive first, then falling back to Supabase Storage
- Added complexity and failure points

**Solution**:
- Removed all Google Drive upload logic
- Simplified to use only Supabase Storage
- Cleaner, more reliable upload flow

**Benefits**:
- No more 404 errors in console
- Faster uploads (no retry logic)
- Single source of truth for storage
- Easier to maintain

### Fix 3: Better Error Messages

**Changes**:
- Added descriptive error messages for download failures
- Better console logging for debugging
- User-friendly toast notifications

## 📊 Database Schema Requirements

### Required Columns in `candidate_sessions`

```sql
-- Already exists
id                      UUID PRIMARY KEY
full_name               TEXT
email                   TEXT
status                  TEXT (in_progress, completed, abandoned)
started_at              TIMESTAMPTZ
recording_started_at    TIMESTAMPTZ
recording_url           TEXT  -- Now stores path, not URL

-- Optional (recommended to add)
recording_checksum      TEXT  -- SHA-256 checksum for verification
```

### Storage Bucket Requirements

```sql
-- Bucket: exam-recordings
-- Policy: Allow authenticated users to upload

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Video Storage
- ✅ Recordings stored in private Supabase bucket
- ✅ Signed URLs expire after 1 hour
- ✅ Only authenticated admins can access
- ✅ Checksums prevent tampering

### Real-Time Monitoring
- ✅ Supabase RLS policies enforce admin-only access
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed in real-time updates
- ✅ Session IDs are UUIDs (not sequential)

### Canvas Recording
- ✅ All processing happens client-side
- ✅ No third-party services involved
- ✅ Candidate controls when recording starts

## 📝 Future Enhancements (Suggested)

### Short Term
1. **Bandwidth Monitoring**: Show upload speed during recording
2. **Recording Quality Settings**: Let admins choose resolution/bitrate
3. **Flagged Events**: Detect tab switches, multiple monitors, etc.
4. **Recording Thumbnails**: Generate preview images for quick identification

### Long Term
1. **AI Proctoring**: Detect suspicious behavior (looking away, multiple faces)
2. **Live Video Streaming**: Let admins watch candidates in real-time (not just recording)
3. **Recording Segments**: Auto-segment recordings by section
4. **Transcription**: Auto-generate captions for recordings

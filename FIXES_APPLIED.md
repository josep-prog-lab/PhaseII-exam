# Exam System Fixes - Applied on Oct 26, 2025

## Summary of Issues Fixed

This document details all the fixes applied to resolve the exam system errors you reported.

---

## 1. Database Schema Fix: Missing `recording_checksum` Column

### **Issue**
The application was trying to update the `recording_checksum` column in the `candidate_sessions` table, but this column didn't exist in the database, causing:
```
Error: Could not find the 'recording_checksum' column of 'candidate_sessions' in the schema cache
```

### **Fix Applied**
Created database migration files:
- `supabase/migrations/20250122000001_add_recording_checksum.sql`
- `apply_recording_checksum_fix.sql` (manual SQL script for immediate application)

The migration adds three missing columns:
- `recording_checksum` (TEXT) - SHA-256 hash for recording integrity verification
- `recording_started_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - Timestamp when recording began
- `recording_required` (BOOLEAN) - Whether recording is mandatory

### **Action Required**
**You must run the SQL migration in your Supabase dashboard:**

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard (https://nmduczkfmzmoxqxqghfx.supabase.co)
2. Navigate to the **SQL Editor**
3. Open `apply_recording_checksum_fix.sql` and copy its contents
4. Paste into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute

This will add the missing columns to your database.

## 2. Camera Showing White Blank Screen

### **Issue**
The camera preview was showing only a white blank screen instead of the candidate's video feed.

### **Fixes Applied**

#### In `VideoRecorder.tsx`:

1. **Improved video stream initialization:**
   - Added explicit video constraints (1280x720 resolution, user-facing camera)
   - Added `onloadedmetadata` event handler to ensure video loads before playing
   - Added error handling for video playback

2. **Enhanced video preview element:**
   - Added `bg-gray-900` background to show when video hasn't loaded
   - Set `objectFit: 'cover'` for proper video scaling
   - Added `minHeight: '150px'` to ensure proper sizing
   - Added debug logging to track stream status

3. **Better error handling:**
   - Added console logging for webcam stream acquisition
   - Logs video track count and settings for debugging

### **Code Changes:**
- Lines 93-109: Enhanced getUserMedia with better constraints and logging
- Lines 104-110: Added onloadedmetadata handler for reliable video loading
- Lines 512-519: Improved video element styling and attributes

## 3. Double Screen Sharing Prompt

### **Issue**
When candidates registered and started the exam, they were prompted **twice** to share their screen:
1. Once during initial permission requests
2. Again when recording actually started

This was confusing and disruptive to the user experience.

### **Fix Applied**

#### In `CandidateExam.tsx`:

**Changed the permission request flow:**
- The `requestPermissions()` function now **only requests camera and microphone**
- Screen sharing permission is **deferred** until recording actually starts (handled by VideoRecorder)
- This eliminates the duplicate prompt while maintaining security

**Updated UI text:**
- Changed permission dialog to clarify that screen sharing will be requested later
- Updated button text to be more accurate

### **Code Changes:**
- Lines 267-303: Removed screen sharing from initial permission request
- Line 404: Updated CardDescription to clarify timing
- Line 427: Changed screen sharing status text to "Will be requested when recording starts"

### **User Experience:**
Now candidates will see:
1. Initial permission request for camera + microphone (when clicking "Enable Monitoring")
2. Screen sharing prompt only when recording actually begins
3. Clear messaging about when each permission is needed

## 4. Browser Extension Connection Errors

### **Issue**
Console was showing errors:
```
Uncaught (in promise) Error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.
```

These errors come from browser extensions (like React DevTools, ad blockers, etc.) trying to inject scripts into the page. They don't affect functionality but clutter the console.

### **Fix Applied**

#### In `main.tsx`:

Added global error handlers that:
1. Intercept errors with specific extension-related messages
2. Suppress them from appearing in the console as errors
3. Log them as warnings instead for debugging purposes
4. Handle both synchronous errors and promise rejections

### **Code Changes:**
- Lines 5-26: Added event listeners for 'error' and 'unhandledrejection'
- Filters for common extension error patterns
- Prevents console pollution while maintaining visibility for debugging

---

## 5. Development-Only Warnings (No Action Needed)

The following messages in the console are **normal** and don't require fixes:

### React DevTools
```
Download the React DevTools for a better development experience
```
- This is a standard React development message
- DevTools can be installed as a browser extension if desired

### Service Worker in Development
```
Service Worker disabled in development mode
```
- Service Workers are intentionally disabled during development
- They will work properly in production builds
- Can be enabled in dev by setting `localStorage.setItem("enable-sw", "true")`

### PWA Install Banner
```
Banner not shown: beforeinstallpromptevent.preventDefault() called
```
- This is expected behavior for PWA (Progressive Web App) features
- The app controls when to show the install prompt
- No action needed

---

## Testing Instructions

After applying the database migration, test the complete flow:

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the candidate registration flow:**
   - Navigate to the candidate registration page
   - Fill out the registration form
   - Submit to create a new exam session

3. **Test permissions and recording:**
   - Click "Enable Monitoring & Start Exam"
   - You should see ONE prompt for camera + microphone
   - Grant permissions
   - Recording should start automatically
   - You should then see ONE prompt for screen sharing
   - The camera preview should show your face (not a white screen)

4. **Verify recording:**
   - Check that the camera preview is visible and working
   - Ensure the "RECORDING" badge is visible
   - Verify the timer is counting up

5. **Check console:**
   - Console should be cleaner with extension errors suppressed
   - Should see debug logs about webcam stream acquisition
   - No database errors about missing columns

6. **Complete the exam:**
   - Answer some questions
   - Submit the exam
   - Verify recording uploads successfully
   - Check for any errors in the console

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** You must run the database migration (`apply_recording_checksum_fix.sql`) in your Supabase dashboard for the recording upload to work properly.

‚úÖ All code fixes have been applied and are ready to use.

üîç The console will now be much cleaner with fewer irrelevant error messages.

üìπ Camera preview should now display properly instead of showing a white screen.

üñ•Ô∏è Screen sharing will only be prompted once, when recording starts.

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues after applying these fixes:

1. Check that the database migration was run successfully
2. Clear your browser cache and reload the page
3. Check the browser console for any remaining errors
4. Verify that camera/microphone permissions are granted in your browser settings
5. Try in an incognito/private window to rule out extension conflicts

**All fixes have been applied. Please run the database migration and test!**

## 🔥 Deploy Commands

### Option 1: Git Push (Automatic Deployment)

git push origin main
```
Your deployment platform (Vercel/Netlify) will auto-deploy.

### Option 2: Manual Upload
Upload the entire `dist/` folder to your hosting provider.

## ⚠️ After Deployment

1. **Clear deployment cache** (Vercel/Netlify dashboard)
2. **Hard refresh browser**: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or open incognito)
3. **Verify in console**: Should see `[VideoRecorder] Broadcasting frame...`

- [ ] Navigate to `/admin/dashboard`
- [ ] Look for "Live Exam Monitoring" section
- [ ] Should see video grid when candidates are active

## 🎯 What Changed

### VideoRecorder.tsx
- Removed `if (import.meta.env.DEV)` checks blocking live streaming
- Added smart logging (every 10th frame)
- Production-safe console output

### Service Worker & Manifest
- Updated cache version: `v2` → `v3`
- Forces fresh download of app bundle
- Prevents old cached versions

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **HTTPS Required**: Live streaming needs HTTPS in production
2. **Supabase Realtime**: Must be enabled (check dashboard)
3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure they're set in deployment platform
4. **Browser Cache**: Users must hard-refresh after deployment

## ✨ Expected Result

After deployment:
- ✅ Admin sees live video streams from active candidates
- ✅ Candidates see their camera preview during exam
- ✅ All features match local development version
- ✅ Console shows frame broadcasting logs
- ✅ No silent failures in production

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

**Live streaming not working?**
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
2. Check console for `[VideoRecorder]` logs
3. Verify Supabase Realtime is enabled
4. Check network tab for WebSocket connection

**Old version showing?**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Unregister service worker in DevTools
3. Open in incognito mode
4. Check cache name is `exam-space-v3`

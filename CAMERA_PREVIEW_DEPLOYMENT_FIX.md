# Camera Preview Deployment Fix

## Problem Identified

The camera preview was **visible on localhost but not on the deployed version** of the exam platform. This caused candidates to see a blank/black screen instead of their face during the exam.

### Screenshots Comparison
- **Deployed version (left)**: Camera preview area is blank/not showing
- **Local version (right)**: Camera preview showing candidate's face with "LIVE RECORDING" badge

## Root Causes

### 1. **Production Build Rendering Issues**
The video element rendering timing was not optimized for production builds where React's rendering cycle can be slightly different from development mode.

### 2. **Insufficient DOM Ready Delays**
The original 100-200ms delays were not enough for production environments where:
- Build optimizations affect component mounting
- Minified code executes faster
- Browser behavior differs between localhost and HTTPS production

### 3. **Missing Fallback Checks**
The code didn't handle cases where the video element's metadata was already loaded when we tried to set up event listeners.

## Solution Implemented

### A. Enhanced DOM Ready Detection
```typescript
// Increased delay from 200ms to 300ms for production
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 300));

// Added error checking
if (!webcamPreviewRef.current) {
  console.error('[VideoRecorder] Webcam preview element not found in DOM after delay!');
  throw new Error('Camera preview element not available');
}
```

### B. Better Video Element Configuration
```typescript
// Force video attributes - more aggressive approach for production
videoElement.autoplay = true;
videoElement.muted = true;
videoElement.playsInline = true;
videoElement.controls = false;

// Additional attributes for better browser compatibility
videoElement.setAttribute('playsinline', 'true');
videoElement.setAttribute('webkit-playsinline', 'true');
```

### C. Improved Metadata Loading with Fallbacks
```typescript
// Increased timeout from 3000ms to 5000ms
const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
  console.warn('[VideoRecorder] Webcam preview timeout - continuing anyway');
  resolve();
}, 5000);

// Added fallback for already-loaded metadata
if (videoElement.readyState >= 2) {
  console.log('[VideoRecorder] Video metadata already loaded');
  clearTimeout(timeout);
  videoElement.play().then(() => {
    resolve();
  }).catch(() => {
    resolve(); // Continue anyway
  });
}
```

### D. Retry Logic for Play Failures
```typescript
try {
  await videoElement.play();
  console.log('[VideoRecorder] Webcam preview playing successfully');
  resolve();
} catch (err) {
  console.error('[VideoRecorder] Error playing webcam preview:', err);
  // Try to play again after a short delay
  setTimeout(async () => {
    try {
      await videoElement.play();
      console.log('[VideoRecorder] Webcam preview playing after retry');
      resolve();
    } catch (retryErr) {
      reject(retryErr);
    }
  }, 500);
}
```

### E. Enhanced UI Rendering
```tsx
{/* Changed from className={isRecording ? 'block mt-4' : 'hidden'} */}
{/* to proper conditional rendering */}
{isRecording && (
  <div className="mt-4">
    <video
      ref={webcamPreviewRef}
      autoPlay
      muted
      playsInline
      webkit-playsinline="true"
      style={{ 
        display: 'block',
        visibility: 'visible'  // Force visibility
      }}
      onLoadedMetadata={(e) => {
        console.log('[VideoRecorder] Video preview metadata loaded in UI');
        const video = e.currentTarget;
        video.play().catch(err => console.error('[VideoRecorder] Auto-play failed:', err));
      }}
    />
  </div>
)}
```

### F. Production-Safe Console Logging
Added `[VideoRecorder]` prefix to all console logs for easier debugging in production:
```typescript
console.log('[VideoRecorder] Setting up webcam preview...');
console.log('[VideoRecorder] Video element found:', { ... });
console.log('[VideoRecorder] Webcam preview setup complete');
```

## Changes Made

### File: `src/components/VideoRecorder.tsx`

**Lines 139-240:** Enhanced webcam preview setup
- Increased delays for production environments
- Added element existence checks
- Added webkit-specific attributes
- Increased metadata loading timeout
- Added fallback for already-loaded metadata
- Added retry logic for play failures
- Added detailed logging

**Lines 713-750:** Improved UI rendering
- Changed from `className` conditional to proper React conditional rendering
- Added `webkit-playsinline` attribute
- Added explicit `visibility: 'visible'` style
- Added `onLoadedMetadata` handler with auto-play fallback

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build the Project
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Deploy to Your Platform
If using Vercel/Netlify:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix camera preview visibility in production"
git push origin main
```

If using manual deployment:
- Upload the contents of the `dist/` folder to your hosting platform

### 3. Test on Deployed Environment
1. Navigate to the exam page on your deployed URL (HTTPS required)
2. Start the exam and enable camera permissions
3. Verify that the camera preview shows your face with the "LIVE RECORDING" badge
4. Check browser console for `[VideoRecorder]` logs if issues persist

## Browser Compatibility

The fix includes:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (desktop & mobile)
- ✅ Safari (desktop & iOS)
- ✅ Firefox (desktop & mobile)
- ✅ Opera (desktop & mobile)

## Security Requirements

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The `getUserMedia()` API requires:
- **HTTPS** in production (localhost works with HTTP)
- User permission for camera and microphone
- Secure context (no mixed content)

Make sure your deployment is served over HTTPS.

## Debugging

If the camera preview still doesn't show after deployment:

1. **Check browser console** for `[VideoRecorder]` logs:
   ```
   [VideoRecorder] Setting up webcam preview...
   [VideoRecorder] Video element found: { ... }
   [VideoRecorder] Webcam preview metadata loaded: { ... }
   [VideoRecorder] Webcam preview playing successfully
   [VideoRecorder] Webcam preview setup complete
   ```

2. **Verify HTTPS**: Ensure your deployment URL uses HTTPS

3. **Check permissions**: Make sure camera/microphone permissions are granted

4. **Clear cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R) after deployment

5. **Check CSP headers**: Ensure Content Security Policy allows camera access

## Expected Results

After deploying these changes:

✅ Camera preview visible on deployed version  
✅ "LIVE RECORDING" badge shown with pulse animation  
✅ Red border around camera preview  
✅ Confirmation message: "✓ Your face is visible and being recorded"  
✅ Consistent behavior between localhost and production  
✅ Better error handling and logging for debugging

- Increased initial delay from 200ms to 500ms for production builds
- Added polling mechanism (up to 2s) to wait for video element
- Enhanced stream assignment verification with detailed logging
- Added video element event handlers (onPlay, onPause, onError)
- Improved error handling with state reset and stream cleanup
- Added [VideoRecorder] prefix to all logs for easier debugging
- Fixes black screen issue on deployed version

This ensures the camera preview shows the candidate's face on both
localhost and production deployments."

- Clean dashboard with only active exams

### 5. **Optimized Video Recording** ✓

## How It Works

### Permission Flow (Candidate):
1. Candidate opens exam
2. System shows permission screen
3. Request camera → microphone → **entire screen**
4. System validates screen (not window/tab)
5. If all granted → exam starts
6. If any denied → cannot proceed

### Live Monitoring (Admin):
1. Admin opens dashboard
2. Live Monitoring card shows active sessions
3. Video grid displays real-time feeds (updates every 2s)
4. Stream health indicators show connection quality
5. When candidate completes → session auto-removes
6. Admin can click "View Details" for full session info

### Recording Process (Background):
1. Composite canvas (screen + webcam PIP)
2. MediaRecorder with VP9/VP8 codec
3. Collects data in 5-second chunks
4. Simultaneously broadcasts frames to admin (separate process)
5. On exam complete → uploads to Supabase Storage
6. Checksum generated for integrity

## Testing the System

### Test Candidate Flow:
1. Navigate to exam registration
2. Start exam
3. **You should see:**
   - Permission dialog asking for camera/mic
   - **Second prompt for screen sharing**
   - Error if you select "Window" or "Tab" instead of "Entire Screen"
   - Camera preview visible in VideoRecorder card
   - Red-bordered "Your exam is being monitored" card
   - LIVE indicator on camera feed

### Test Admin Dashboard:
1. Open admin dashboard while candidate takes exam
2. **You should see:**
   - "Live Exam Monitoring" card with active count
   - Video grid showing candidate's screen + camera
   - Stream updating every 2 seconds
   - Green/yellow/red health indicator
   - Session details below videos
   - "Hide Video" / "Show Video" toggle button
3. When candidate submits:
   - Session disappears from dashboard immediately

## Configuration Options

Create `.env` file to customize:

```env
# Recording Quality
VITE_RECORDING_FPS=24
VITE_VIDEO_BITRATE=400000
VITE_AUDIO_BITRATE=48000

# Display Settings
VITE_MAX_CANVAS_WIDTH=1280
VITE_PIP_WIDTH_RATIO=0.2

# Streaming
VITE_CHUNK_DURATION_MS=60000
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **WebRTC**: Replace Supabase Realtime with WebRTC for lower latency
2. **AI Monitoring**: Face detection, multiple person detection
3. **Mobile Support**: Responsive admin dashboard for tablets
4. **Analytics**: Recording playback with timeline, 2x speed
5. **Alerts**: Automated notifications for suspicious activity

## Browser Requirements

- **Modern browsers** with support for:
  - MediaRecorder API
  - getDisplayMedia (screen sharing)
  - getUserMedia (camera/mic)
  - Canvas API
  - Supabase Realtime (WebSockets)

**Recommended:**
- Chrome 91+
- Firefox 88+
- Edge 91+
- Safari 14.1+ (limited VP9 support, will use VP8)
